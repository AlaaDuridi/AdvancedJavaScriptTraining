<h2> Project2 : TODO App </h2>

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>

<p>Create a NodeJS/JavaScript application that manages a to-do list.<br>
- The app should include features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed,<br>
 deleting tasks, filtering the list by completed or incomplete tasks, 
 and sorting tasks by the due date or priority.<br>
- To create the Task object with properties like task description, due date, and priority level, use prototypes.<br>
- Manage the list of tasks using arrays and array methods such as push(), filter(), and sort().<br>
- When a user adds a new task, create a new Task object and add it to the array.<br>
- When a user marks a task as completed, use filter() to find the task in the array and update its status.<br>
- When a user deletes a task, remove it from the array using splice().<br>
- You mean need to use something like (stdin) to read input from the user (Google it)<br>
- Print for the user a list of actions that he can do.<br>

Example:<br>
