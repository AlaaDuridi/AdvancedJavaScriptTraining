Project: "Movie Catalog CLI Application"<br>

Description:<br>
Create a Command Line Interface (CLI) application in Node.js that allows users to manage a movie catalog. The application will incorporate<br>
concepts such as object-oriented programming, prototypes, arrays, ES6 features, async programming, HTTP requests using the Fetch API, file <br>handling, and module usage.<br>

Features:<br>

Display Movie Catalog: Read movie data from a JSON file and display a list of movies in the catalog.<br>

Add New Movie: Allow users to add new movies to the catalog by providing details such as title, director, release year, and genre. The movie data<br> should be stored in the JSON file.<br>

Update Movie Details: Enable users to edit the details of a specific movie by selecting the movie from the catalog and updating its properties <br>like title, director, release year, and genre.<br>

Delete Movie: Allow users to remove a movie from the catalog by selecting the movie and deleting it from the JSON file.<br>

Search and Filter: Implement search functionality that allows users to search for movies by title, director, or genre. Additionally, provide <br>options for filtering the movie catalog based on specific criteria like genre or release year.<br>

Fetch Movie Data: Utilize the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to a movie database API (such as OMDB API) to fetch additional movies from the API <br>and store it in the JSON file.<br>

Modules: Structure the project using modules to separate concerns and improve maintainability. Create separate modules for file handling,<br> movie management, API requests, and user interaction.<br>

Async Programming: Implement asynchronous operations using Promises or async/await to handle file read/write operations and API requests.<br>
